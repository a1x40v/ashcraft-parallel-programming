/*
    Parallel.ForEach is probably the most used member of the Parallel class in .NET. This is
because, in many cases, you can simply take the body of a standard foreach loop and use it inside
a Parallel.ForEach loop. However, when introducing any parallelism into a code base, you
must be sure that the code being invoked is thread-safe. If the body of a Parallel.ForEach loop
modifies any of the collections, you will either need to employ one of the synchronization methods
discussed in Chapter 1, or use one of .NETâ€™s concurrent collections.
