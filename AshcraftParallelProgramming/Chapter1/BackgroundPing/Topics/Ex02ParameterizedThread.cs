/*
    Creating managed threads in .NET is accomplished by instantiating a new Thread object. The
Thread class has four constructor overloads:

    - Thread(ParameterizedThreadStart): This creates a new Thread object. It does
this by passing a delegate with a constructor that takes an object as its parameter that can be
passed when calling Thread.Start().

    - Thread(ThreadStart): This creates a new Thread object that will execute the method
to be invoked, which is provided as the ThreadStart property.

    - Thread(ParameterizedThreadStart, Int32): This adds a maxStackSize
parameter. Avoid using this overload because it is best to allow .NET to manage the stack size.

    - Thread(ThreadStart, Int32): This adds a maxStackSize parameter. Avoid
using this overload because it is best to allow .NET to manage the stack size.

    Our first example used the Thread(ThreadStart) constructor. Letâ€™s look at a version of
that code that uses ParameterizedThreadStart to pass a value by limiting the number of
iterations of the while loop
